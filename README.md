# LabControl

Classroom fleet control for a single computer lab: **one teacher console
(macOS / Windows / Linux)** managing **14 Windows student PCs** on the same LAN —
live screen mosaic with remote control, Wake-on-LAN / shutdown / reboot, silent
software installs and scripts on all PCs at once, teacher-screen broadcast, screen lock,
a composable exam mode, and a **one-shot USB installer** that prepares a PC completely
(service, firewall, WoL, `student` user with auto-logon) in one run.

Self-hosted, no server, no cloud, no domain, no internet required on the student PCs.

The teacher machine is **replaceable**: the lab's identity is a private certificate
authority, not the laptop's certificate, so moving the console to another computer —
macOS, Windows or Linux — means importing one encrypted backup file, and no student PC is
touched. The software is designed for labs of up to 30 PCs, not just the first one's 14.

Built with .NET 10 + Avalonia + gRPC. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the project
brief and [`docs/`](docs/) for architecture, protocol, installer and roadmap.

## Status

**M0 — skeleton and toolchain: done (2026-09-04).**

**M1 — lab identity, link and presence: built, awaiting the live demonstration.** The
trust model, the beacon, mutual TLS, enrolment, the link with jobs and renewal, take-over
between two teacher machines, the sealed backup, the console UI and a `FakeAgent` that
plays a room of PCs are all in place and green under `dotnet test` (137 tests, including
real UDP and TLS on the loopback and headless renders of every window). The remaining step
is the owner running the M1 acceptance list by hand — see
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Quick start
```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet run --project src/LabControl.Console            # first run: the wizard creates a lab
#   Settings → Write USB payload… → choose a folder, e.g. ~/usb
dotnet run --project src/LabControl.FakeAgent -- --count 14 --payload ~/usb
#   in the console: Enrol PCs… → passphrase → the PCs enrol and appear
tools/publish-all.sh
tools/docs-build.sh
```

Two console profiles on one machine (the alternation and take-over tests):

```bash
dotnet run --project src/LabControl.Console -- --data ~/labA --port 47800
dotnet run --project src/LabControl.Console -- --data ~/labB --port 47810   # import the backup from A
```

`FakeAgent --fail 7:never --fail 8:late=20 --fail 9:die-mid-job --fail 10:job-error
--fail 11:burned-code --fail 12:forged-revocation --fail 13:outdated` injects failures;
`--reinstall 7` plays a reinstalled PC; `--console 127.0.0.1` pins the console on a
machine with no network. Screenshots of the UI from the headless tests:
`LABCONTROL_UI_SHOTS=/tmp/shots dotnet test --project tests/LabControl.Console.Tests`.

Requires the .NET 10 SDK and nothing else. The `net10.0-windows` projects compile on
macOS and Linux too (they just cannot run there), so a broken Windows build is caught
immediately rather than at the next visit to the lab.
